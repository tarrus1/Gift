# Gift
The idea is to create a marketplace where lenders and borrowers can meet to take out microloans. 
As a result, borrowers can obtain funds without the intervention of an intermediary. 
After both parties have reached an agreement, the lender can prepare a loan that can be redeemed by the borrower using a code. 
To accomplish this we can use the  Gift.hs
